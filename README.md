# Hi, I'm Yazdum 👋

**Full-Stack Developer**

I develop production-ready web services, bots, and integrations — from architecture and prototyping to deployment and technical support.  
I work confidently with both frontend and backend, focusing on stability, maintainability, and predictable environments.

## 🧩 About Me

I am a full-stack developer with around **2 years of commercial experience**.  
I have participated in **15+ projects**, **6 of which were implemented completely from scratch** — including frontend, backend, third-party integrations, deployment on Linux servers, and Docker-based environments.

My experience covers:
- corporate web services
- Telegram and VK bots
- integrations with **1C** and **CRM systems**
- database design and optimization
- adaptive and practical UI

I take projects to production and support them after release.
